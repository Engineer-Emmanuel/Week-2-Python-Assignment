# Week-2-Python-Assignment

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates common list manipulation techniques. The script performs a series of operations on a list, illustrating how to:

Initialize a list with elements

Insert a new element at a specific position

Extend the list by adding multiple elements

Remove the last element from the list

Sort the list in ascending order

Find and display the index of a specific element within the list

Script Description
The script performs the following steps:

Creates a list with initial elements [10,. Inserts the value 15` at the second position (index 1).

Extends the list by adding [50,. Removes the last element (which is 70`).

Sorts the list in ascending order.

Finds and prints the index of the value 30 in the sorted list.
